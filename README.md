# Email.sender

Send out e-mails using Homey flows.

If you wish to send through Gmail SMTP servers, you first need to allow less secure apps on Gmail via https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps

Use your complete @gmail.com mail address as the username, smtp.gmail.com as the SMTP server and SMTP port 587.
